# Synergy-city-network-and-horizontal-links(accompanying data and code)
This little repository offers data and code accompanying the manuscript of 'Synergy city networks and horizontal linkages of high-tech firms in China'.
The data is taken from the China Non-listed Enterprise Database (1998-2008). This database is administered by GTA Company and sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.


## Running the Matlab code

To run the code for the meso-scale structure of the subsector of 'Office and computing machinery'(abbr.'cmp'), just download the two datasets for matrix (matrix_office&computer.mat') and nodes (nodecmp.mat), and run:

```
cmp.m
```
To inspect the networks, just take the file `cmp.tsv`
[cmp.csv](https://github.com/ddshen3/synergy-city-network-and-horizontal-links/files/11050339/cmp.csv)

To run the code for the meso-scale structure of the subsector of 'Technology hardware and equipment'(abbr.'ele'), just download the two datasets for matrix (matrix_ele.mat') and nodes (nodeele.mat), and run:

```
ele.m
```
To inspect the networks, just take the file `ele.tsv`
[ele.csv](https://github.com/ddshen3/synergy-city-network-and-horizontal-links/files/11050765/ele.csv)

To run the code for the meso-scale structure of the subsector of 'Pharmaceuticals and biotech'(abbr.'bio'), just download the two datasets for matrix (matrix_bio.mat') and nodes (nodebio.mat), and run:

```
bio.m
```
To inspect the networks, just take the file `bio.tsv`
[bio.csv](https://github.com/ddshen3/synergy-city-network-and-horizontal-links/files/11050921/bio.csv)
